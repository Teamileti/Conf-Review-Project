Title = CRS - Conference Review System
MainText = Our unique system allows users to manage paper and abstract submissions and peer reviewing activities from one central location. A paper review actually serves a remarkable number of different purposes, though it\u2019s rarely mentioned.
LineOne= Here are some examples:
LineTwo = \u2022 A review serves as a record which partially documents and justifies the committee\u2019s decision to accept or reject the paper, and its reasons for doing do.
LineThree = \u2022 A review provides feedback to the authors on how to improve the paper or otherwise proceed with their work, regardless of whether it\u2019s accepted or not.
LineFour = \u2022 A review communicates your thoughts about the paper to other PC members.
LineFive = There usually isn\u2019t time to talk about all the details of a review in the PC meeting itself, and reading fellow PC members\u2019 reviews is an important time-saving technique. Typically, one reviewer will be called upon to summarize the paper, all the paper\u2019s reviews, and their personal opinion in the meeting, and others chime in with other thoughts.
